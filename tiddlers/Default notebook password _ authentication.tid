title: Default notebook password / authentication
type: text/vnd.tiddlywiki

When you try to access the a VCE environment / notebook server in your browser for the first time, you will be presented with a password / token authentication challenge. By default, the token `letmein` will provide access.

Jupyter server default login token: `letmein`

You can create your own token when issuing the initial `docker run` command  on the command line by adding the phrase `-e JUPYTER_TOKEN="myN3ws3cretTOKEN!"` (using your own quoted token value, as required) before the `DOCKER_IMAGE_NAME:TAG` element.
